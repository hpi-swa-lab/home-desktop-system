An domain object linkt is a serializable representation of a reference to a domain object. When a domain object is written to disk, all references from this domain object are replaced with domain object links. These are then serialized to the domain object file. When the domain object which includes links is loaded, the links are NOT yet resolved. Instead they remain in-place until we access the field. On access the link looks for a DomainObject or a DomainObjectOnDisk to replace itself.
